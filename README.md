## 🎴 Animated Fantasy Cards

A visually stunning set of 3D animated fantasy character cards built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. Each card features a unique magic-themed character, rotating conic-gradient borders, perspective tilt, hover glow effects, and clean fantasy styling. Smooth animations and vibrant colors bring the cards to life.

## 💡 How It Works
1. Conic-gradient is animated through a rotating CSS custom property  
2. Hovering a card activates the animation and glow  
3. Perspective and rotateY create the 3D angled look  
4. Each card uses a different border glow color  
5. Smooth transitions enhance interaction and visual depth  

## 🔧 Customization
- Change glow colors inside card hover states  
- Adjust rotation speed in @keyframes  
- Replace character images in assets/images  
- Modify tilt angle using rotateY  
- Add more cards by duplicating card markup  

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- GSAP entrance animations  
- Parallax mouse tracking  
- Click-to-flip card info  
- Dynamic character data from JSON  
- Gradient aura around cards
